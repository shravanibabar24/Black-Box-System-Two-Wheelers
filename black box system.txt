# Black Box System for Two-Wheelers

## Overview
This project presents a low-cost Black Box System designed for two-wheelers to improve road safety.
It detects accidents, records sensor data, captures images, and sends real-time emergency alerts.

## Features
- Accident detection using MPU6050
- GPS tracking with NEO-6M
- Emergency SMS alerts via SIM800L
- Alcohol detection using MQ-3
- Image capture using ESP32-CAM
- Environmental monitoring using DHT22

## Hardware Used
- ESP32-CAM (OV2640)
- Arduino UNO
- MPU6050
- NEO-6M GPS
- MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor
- DHT22
- MAX4466 Microphone
- SIM800L GSM Module
- Relay Module

## Software Tools
- Arduino IDE
- EasyEDA
- Fritzing
- Fusion 360

## Working
The system continuously monitors sensor data. If an accident is detected, it captures images,
records data, and sends an emergency SMS with GPS location.

## Future Scope
- PCB fabrication
- Mobile app integration
- AI-based crash detection
- Cloud data storage
